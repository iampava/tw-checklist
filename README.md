# TW Checklist | practice app for students

This is a  **ToDo with login** practice app for the Web Technologies laboratories I taught at UAIC University in Iasi. It doesn't contain much functionality but  building it requires you to tackle fundamental knowledge of the Web, which makes it perfect for students 🚀

The app uses: 

* 🐘 MVC Back-End architecture built in [PHP](https://secure.php.net/docs.php)
* 💾 MySQL database 
* 🔒 [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/) authentification plus our own custom auth
* 📧 [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX) for marking todo's as "DONE" without reloading the hole page

### Branches & tags

You can find the final version of the App on the [final branch](https://github.com/iampava/tw-checklist/tree/final)
